# Information Security Labs

Welcome to the Information Security Labs! This series of labs is designed to provide hands-on experience with various aspects of information security, focusing on common vulnerabilities and attack techniques. Through these labs, you'll gain practical knowledge about buffer overflows, return-to-libc attacks, and other important concepts in cybersecurity.

## Lab Overview

1. [Lab 1 - Buffer Overflow Basics](./lab-1/index.md)
   - Explore fundamental buffer overflow vulnerabilities
   - Practice exploiting simple programs with buffer overflows

2. [Lab 2 - Advanced Buffer Overflow](./lab-2/index.md)
   - Dive deeper into buffer overflow techniques
   - Learn about shellcode injection and execution

3. [Lab 3 - Return-to-libc Attack](./lab-3/index.md)
   - Understand the return-to-libc attack technique
   - Practice bypassing non-executable stack protections

Each lab contains detailed instructions, code samples, and step-by-step guides to help you understand and execute the concepts. Remember to always practice these techniques in a controlled, legal environment.

## Important Note

The techniques and vulnerabilities discussed in these labs are for educational purposes only. It is crucial to use this knowledge responsibly and ethically. Never attempt to exploit systems or networks without explicit permission.

Happy learning, and stay secure!
